## About

1972 vintage human meatbag. By day I work as a Director of Developer Relations, at [Anchore](https://www.anchore.com/). By night I'm a married dad to two amazing kids. I also like cats, but really want a dog.

## Personal Projects

Some current, past and maybe future projects of mine:

### In use ###

Projects I actively work on.

  * https://popey.com/ (duh)
  * https://linuxmatters.sh/ - A podcast I do with my friends.
  * https://ubuntu.social/ - A mastodon instance I spun up from the pub, tore down, and then rebuilt on decent hardware from [Linode](https://www.linode.com/?r=49a71a9eddc09fbca846964312f36841f25e52a8)
  * https://makealinux.app/ - Stop making Linux distributions, make applications instead
  * https://popeyspad.es/ - OpenSpades server info
  
### Baking ###

Things I plan to do something with, but haven't quite got to yet.

### Retiring ###

Projects I probably should retire.

### Retired ###

Retired projects.

  * https://tipcast.org/ - a podcast project that never happened, but might, who knows!?
  * https://ubuntuupdate.com/ - was used for a podcast
  * https://ubuntupodcast.org/ - A podcast, about Ubuntu (mostly) which I present with Mark and Martin. 
  * [https://havethebuttonsmovedbackyet.com/](https://web.archive.org/web/20100418014620/https://havethebuttonsmovedbackyet.com/) - This was a little poke at people who complained bitterly when we moved the window controls from the right to the left of the window, in Unity. I made this site which had "No" on it until 2017 when we switched to GNOME Shell and with it, the window controls moved back. Hence the screenshot on the site [now](https://web.archive.org/web/20180420201033/https://havethebuttonsmovedbackyet.com/).
