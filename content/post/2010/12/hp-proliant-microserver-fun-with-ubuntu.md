I recently took delivery of a new [HP ProLiant MicroServer](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0042ORTWM?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=popey-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B0042ORTWM) which I wanted to use for various small/home office server type tasks. It's a cracking little server, ideal for small offices and home users who want a small, low-power server. With only one fan in the case it's fairly quiet with most noise coming from the hard disk supplied, and any more you put in it.

The reason I got it was because HP are currently giving [Â£100 cash-back](http://www.hp.com/uk/proliantmicroserver/) (until end of January 2011) on the ProLiant MicroServer. Given how cheap it already is the cash-back makes it even more attractive! It's not super powerful and certainly not "pro server grade" kit, but perfect for my needs. 

* 1.3GHz Dual-Core passively cooled AMD CPU
* 1GB RAM (maximum 8GB)
* 160GB SATA hard disk (3 additional drive bays with drive caddies (~~but no screws!~~ screws are in the bottom of the door))
* 7 USB ports (two rear, four front, one internal)
* 1 gigabit ethernet port
* 1 eSATA port
* 1 VGA port
* 2 PCI Express (x16 and x1)

If you want to see more technical info then I've put online the output from [lspci](/blog/text/2010-12-30/lspci.txt), [cpuinfo](/blog/text/2010-12-30/cpuinfo.txt), [dmesg](/blog/text/2010-12-30/dmesg.txt) and [lshw](/blog/text/2010-12-30/lshw.txt).

**Update:** I've added the results of running [Unixbench](http://www.tux.org/pub/tux/niemi/unixbench/) [here](/blog/text/2010-12-30/unixbench.txt).

As is common with many servers, the device ships with no operating system installed and it has no optical drive so I chose to install Ubuntu 10.04.1 (LTS) from a USB key I had kicking around. On my desktop PC I simply plugged in the key &amp; started up <a href="http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/">unetbootin</a> and chose "10.04_NetInstall_x64" from the list of distributions and my USB key from the list of drives, then clicked OK.

The BIOS on the HP MicroServer is a little quirky when dealing with boot devices. I had to fiddle about a bit to get it to boot off of the USB key, but once booted I was able to go through the installer with the server connected to the network and install a base Ubuntu Server on the single 160GB internal disk. I chose to install onto a 10GB root partition with some swap space allocated but the rest of the disk left blank for now. 

One mistake I made during installation was to install the grub boot loader on `/dev/sda` which at the time of install was the USB key, and not the 160GB internal disk! The result was I couldn't boot Ubuntu Server without the USB key attached. D'oh! I fixed this with the `grub-install` command to install it on the internal disk (once I got the right device name from `sudo fdisk -l`) and from that point I could yank the USB stick and boot normally.

I had a few spare 200GB disks kicking around that I had from an old server, so I added those into the mix and then used LVM to create one big disk across the 3x200GB disks and the remaining space on the 160GB disk. I didn't use any RAID at all because I'm just playing with it for now. In the future I might invest in a couple of bigger (~1-2TB) disks and maybe use RAID 1, but not for now. It's also worth noting that this is initially going to be a backup server so I don't care too much if a disk fails because the data exists elsewhere.

I have the large LVM volume mounted under `/srv` and am storing all backups in that location. I'll cover how that all works in further blog posts. For now I've put the server away in a cupboard where it's humming away connected to my wired LAN via Devolo dLAN Adapters.

So far I'm running offlineimap and rsnapshot on it to do backups, and I'm playing with a few other applications which I may blog about later :)
