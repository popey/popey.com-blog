I've been playing with the [python-elements](http://packages.ubuntu.com/python-elements) but it seems like the project is dead.

The upstream [website](http://elements.linuxuser.at/) has gone and the packages has had no updates for some time. I'd like to create a simple demo/game along the lines of some of the mini games you find in [WarioWare](https://images.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=warioware+balance+wii&amp;btnG=Search+Images) on the Nintendo Wii. The Python Elements (and box2d) libraries seem to fit the bill but I don't want to code using something that is going to disappear. 

Suggestions for other libraries welcome.

**Update:** seems the python elements is maintained in debian, my mistake. Still keen to hear of libraries in this area.
