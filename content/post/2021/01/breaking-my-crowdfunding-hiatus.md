Just days after blogging about [My Crowdfunding Stats](/blog/2021/01/my-crowdfunding-stats/), I've broken my "no crowdfunding" streak of near 18-months by backing something small, but delightful!

Last night a [tweet](https://twitter.com/brintown/status/1349396612938833921) by [Tom Brinton](https://twitter.com/brintown) crossed my desk. Tom is creating a notebook in which every page is a procedurally generated portable dungeon crawler. The campaign is called "[Tiny Paper Dungeons](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brintown/tiny-paper-dungeons)" and it runs until 2nd February 2021.

Tom has previously made a project in a similar vein called [NUTRI-TRACK](https://gumroad.com/gladden). Collectively these are "Paper Apps", which I find engaging. Yes, I totally get that these are "just" pre-printed pads, I get it. But I love the whole concept of single purpose analog devices which drag us away from "smart" things now and then.

This also hits an intersection of interests for me. I've recently [written](/blog/2021/01/a-problem-with-notebooks/) about my love of (and problem with) paper notebooks. I also have a "[problem](/blog/2021/01/digital-hoarding-gaming-edition/)" with games, and I *love* all things procedurally generated.

So backing this was a no-brainer. I [backed](https://twitter.com/popey/status/1349400684047855618) at the 3-pad level, meaning I get 3 unique pads of procedurally generated "dungeons" to play. Thankfully plenty of others also liked the idea, so the project was easily [fully funded](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brintown/tiny-paper-dungeons/posts/3072796) in just 90 minutes! They've blown past Â£8000 in under 24 hours, with the [potential](https://www.kicktraq.com/projects/brintown/tiny-paper-dungeons/) to go much higher (according to [Kicktraq](https://www.kicktraq.com/)).

If you're interested in portable dungeon crawlers, and supporting indie makers, maybe take a look at the [project page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brintown/tiny-paper-dungeons).
