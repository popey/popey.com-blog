Bit of a rant, sorry. I'm trying to download my data from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/). I login via the web page, find the place to do this, note its says I'll get an "*archive of your data we think is most important to you*". Uh-huh, **you** think. Then click the button.

It takes a *day* to build that archive, and you're not allowed to ask for it again for 30 days. Next day I get a notification so I can download it.

So I dutifully go to the Twitter website and again navigate to this special place to download my archive. Except, the download comes down at 70KB/s! Then fails part way through. At this point the download button greys out so I can't try again! Bah!

I click "Resume" in the browser, but the download doesn't resume, and I can't click the greyed out button on the website anymore to re-initiate a download. Also, I can't request a new archive for another 30 days. So I work around this by going to the download tab in my browser and click the zip file link. It starts downloading fresh again, at around 100KB/s.

My connection is fine, thanks to this [awesome trick](https://blog.popey.com/2020/12/double-your-network-speed-with-this-one-trick/)! It just seems the Twitter archives are hosted on the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_(film)), or [Sealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Sealand) or at the bottom of the [Mariana Trench](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_Trench) or something. 

I'll wait... 

...and write a ranty blog post while I wait.

At this rate I already forgot why I initiated the download in the first place! I am old. Then I remembered, I'm only doing this because I was having a chat with some friends, and mentioned a tweet I'd sent about 10 or so years back, but couldn't find it online. 

With the download taking so long, I decided to investigate Twitter search a little further. I had previously been searching for it with the only word I could recall, "[chopper](https://twitter.com/search?q=(chopper)%20(from%3Apopey)&src=typed_query)", but turned up no results. With a fresh, New Year brain I remembered another word from the tweet - "[spooks](https://twitter.com/search?q=(spooks)%20(from%3Apopey)&src=typed_query)". Boom! [found it](https://twitter.com/popey/status/5458341937).

The bitly link goes to [this photo](https://abpic.co.uk/pictures/view/1165460/) of G-TOPC, the topic of the Tweet. 

Now we can see why my first search didn't work. I made a typo in the tweet. Oops, my bad!

Perhaps a positive take on this might be that the search could add a 'fuzzy' option to catch out these kinds of typos 

`"No, results for 'chopper' but (1) result for 'choper'"`. We can dream.

Now I wonder if maybe the Twitter download is intentionally slow, so as to make me think I should try a bit harder with the Twitter [Advanced Search](https://twitter.com/search-advanced?)? 

Meanwhile, the download is still going at 32KB/s, long after I started typing this blog post.
