With a keen interest in all things "retro", I've previously bought copies of [Fusion Magazine](https://fusionretrobooks.com/collections/fusion-magazine), which I've enjoyed. Shortly after I blogged yesterday about [The Best Portable Spectrum](https://blog.popey.com/2020/12/the-best-portable-spectrum/), I received a marketing email from [Fusion Retro Books](https://fusionretrobooks.com/). With impeccable timing, they're promoting a **new** Spectrum game, called [Neadeital](https://fusionretrobooks.com/products/neadeital-digital-version) by Matt Birch.

They had me at the screenshot. I was a big fan of [Tir Na Nog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tir_Na_Nog_(video_game)), [Dun Durach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dun_Darach) (and [Heavy on the Magick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_on_the_Magick)) as a kid. Neadeital is clearly inspired by those classic titles. 

The game was promoted as part of a Kickstarter campaign for [Crash Annual 2021 - Issue 101](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zzap642021annual/crash-annual-2021-issue-101), which completely passed me by. So I was pretty happy to get the email and investigated further.

The game is being offered for sale for only ¬£4.99 with that money going to [Motor Neuron Disease Association](https://www.mndassociation.org/). **Sold!** The digital download arrived immediately, and was promptly lobbed onto my SD card, ready for loading up on the DS I spoke about [yesterday](https://blog.popey.com/2020/12/the-best-portable-spectrum/).

I love the loading screen, making great use of the *vast* colour pallete of the Spectrum.

The game uses the correct default keys of QAOPM for ‚¨Ü‚¨á‚¨Ö‚û°üî•. Conveniently ZXDS has a shortcut to map these to the D-pad and A button. So it's super quick and easy to setup and get playing.

If you're looking for a new game to play, and can spare the cash for a worthy charity, grab a copy from their [website](https://fusionretrobooks.com/products/neadeital-digital-version). If you don't have a DS, don't worry, you can load this on a real Spectrum too! I hear there are plenty of [emulators](https://worldofspectrum.org/faq/emulators/emulators.htm) if you're not blessed with Sir Clive's greatest hardware creation. üôè
