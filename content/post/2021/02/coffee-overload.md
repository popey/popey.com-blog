Only weeks ago, I blogged about [Trying Proper Coffee](/blog/2021/02/trying-proper-coffee/). Well, I tucked into the [Lavazza](https://geni.us/15brRH9) (affiliate link) and ran out this week! I only bought the Lavazza because I recognised the brand, and needed *something* to drink. With me running low, I wanted to get suggestions for what to try next on my coffee journey.

So I put the call out to "Coffee Twitter"!

Well, everyone was super helpful, and now I have a bunch of coffee to try this week!
