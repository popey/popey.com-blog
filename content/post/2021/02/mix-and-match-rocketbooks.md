Last month I '[discovered](/blog/2021/01/discovering-rocketbooks/)' Rocketbooks. Well, now I'm in deep! I've picked up a bunch of coloured pens, a large folio cover for the full size Rocketbook, and now, I've grabbed some more!

Wait! Surely the point of Rocketbooks is that they're re-usable, so you don't need to buy many of them. Yeah, true. However, as they're not super expensive, I can actually leave one at my work desk upstairs for business-related things, and another downstairs in the kitchen. 

I don't think it's an unreasonable thing to have a pad nearby in two locations, and not having to keep carting the pad up and down is a benefit too. One further problem I have at my work desk is one of space. I don't have enough room for my keyboard, PC, other desktop gubbins *and* an A4 size pad, let alone the folio case which doubles the size of the Rocketbook.

So I picked up two A5 pads in addition to the A4 one I already had. These fit neatly at the side of my workspace, and afford me easy access to something to write on without rearranging my environment. 

I further levelled these up by mixing and matching the pages. You see Rocketbooks come with either a lined or dotted background. I bought one of each.

It's a little fiddly, but you can remove the spiral binder from each one, pick and choose a selection of pages from the piles and create new mix-Rocketbooks. Getting the plastic spirals off is a little fiddly, and can end up snapping them, so you need to be careful.

But it's only a few minutes work, and pretty satisfying once complete.

Initially I wasn't sure how to arrange the pages, but decided on alternating lined-dotted-lined-dotted rather than half the book lined then the second half dotted. This way I get two lined pages (back to back) to write lists or descriptions, then two dotted faces to draw diagrams, or doodles.

The page numbers all line up because I have pages 1 & 2 from the lined book followed by 3 & 4 from the dotted book in one new mix-Rocketbook. Then the other mix-Rocketbook has the opposite, 1 & 2 from dotted then 3 & 4 from lined. Perfect!

I also did the same for the larger A4 Rocketbook I originally bought. I gave the second mix-Rocketbook to my Son, which he's using for making notes during class.

No doubt someone is likely to tell me now that you can already buy these mix-Rocketbooks and I had no need to unbound and re-bind them. Ah well, it was fun to do over coffee this morning.
