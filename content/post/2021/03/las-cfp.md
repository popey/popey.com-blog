The last event I went to before `The Event` was Linux Application Summit (LAS) in Barcelona, Spain back in November 2019! Time flies. 

LAS is a community organised event, sponsored and supported by the GNOME and KDE projects. The conference is "*designed to accelerate the growth of the Linux application ecosystem by bringing together everyone involved in creating a great Linux application user experience.*". 

In November 2020, the LAS team organised a virtual version of the event. The recorded sessions from both events can be found over on the [Linux Application Summit YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjSsbz2TDxIxBEarbDzNQ4w).

The next LAS will be held online from **May 13th to 15th, 2021**!

This year LAS is a 3-day single-track virtual event. The event includes talks, panels and Q&As on a range of topics appropriate to Linux users, developers and other contributors. The LAS team are looking for talks from application developers, designers, product managers, user experience specialists, community leaders, academics, and anyone who is interested in the state of Linux application design and development!

There's a [Call for Papers](https://linuxappsummit.org/cfp/) open which **closes** a week from now, on **March 22nd 2021**. The team are looking for *regular* talks up to 40 minutes and *lightning* talks around 10 minutes in duration. The topics are Ecosystem Growth, Platform Diversity, Innovation, People & Communications and Legal & Licensing.

I'm wanted to raise awareness of the event in general, and the CfP specifically, especially given the impending deadline. If you're in the Linux app development ecosystem, and feel you have something interesting to contribute, please do [submit an abstract](https://conf.linuxappsummit.org/event/3/abstracts/#submit-abstract)!
