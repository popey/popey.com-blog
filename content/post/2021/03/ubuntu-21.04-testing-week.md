"*Hirsute Hippo*" is the project code-name for what will become **Ubuntu 21.04** when it [releases](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/hirsute-hippo-release-schedule/18539?u=popey) on **April 22nd 2021**.

On **April 1st**, the Beta of Ubuntu Hirsute will be released, but we're no [fools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day)! This is a great time to do some testing!

So, starting on **April 1st**, we're doing another **Ubuntu Testing Week**.

As always, everyone is welcome to test Ubuntu at any point in the year. But during the beta is a good time to focus on testing. 

The images will be (relatively) stable, and should (largely) represent what the final release will look like. That's subject to change though, of course. 

### What to do

### Learn

I made some videos a while back showing what to do, they're still valid.

We have some documentation!

#### Pick a flavour

The Ubuntu project has a diverse community of flavours. Each ISO image needs a good spread of testing. I personally find it's fun to test flavours that I don't use often. Partly to see what's new, but also because a fresh pair of eyes and fingers sometimes discover *sharp corners* that regular users miss, or are used to.

In no particular order, they are:

* Xubuntu
* Kubuntu
* Lubuntu
* Ubuntu Budgie
* Ubuntu MATE
* Ubuntu Studio
* Ubuntu Kylin
* Ubuntu Server

Plus we have some new(er) remixes which could also do with extra eyeballs and testing.

* Ubuntu Cinnamon Remix
* Ubuntu Unity Remix

If you have limited time, just pick one, and test that thoroughly. If you're not busy, grab a few and try them all out. Once you get into a rhythm of testing them, it's pretty easy to work your way down the list and give them all a bit of love.

### Download

The [ISO Tracker](http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/419/builds) links to ISO images for all the supported flavours. 

### Discuss

While the ISO downloads, join the discussion with others in IRC on [#ubuntu-quality](https://webchat.freenode.net/#ubuntu-quality?nick=ubuntu-tester?dis) or in Telegram [Ubuntu Testers](https://t.me/UbuntuTesters). They're a friendly bunch who always want to help others test effectively.

There's also this [discourse thread](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-21-04-testing-week/21519) which announces the Ubuntu Testing Week. 

### Install 

You can install on bare metal, if you have a laptop or desktop to play with. Alternatively, use a virtual machine (VM) on top of an existing Linux install. If you're running Windows or MacOS, you can install in a VM on those platforms too.

### Test

Follow the test cases outlined on the [ISO Tracker](http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/419/builds). There's multiple tests per ISO. We need to test the defaults used in a standard install, but there's a bunch of other options which need validating too. So running the same install repeatedly with different options is just as valuable as running multiple flavours. It all needs testing!

### Report

You found an issue!? Great success!

Now report it! We have a [walkthrough](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/ISO/Walkthrough) which outlines [specifically](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/ISO/Walkthrough#Testing.2FWalkthrough.2FSubmissionTemplate.Submit_a_result) how to report issues.

If you get stuck, drop by the discussion channels and ask for help! 

Remember, **Ubuntu Testing Week** starts on **April 1st**! *Don't be a fool! Get testing!*
