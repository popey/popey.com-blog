I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/popey/status/1380139900108963848) back at the start of April that I'm moving on from Canonical/Ubuntu.

Well, I left on April 30th, have had two weeks of 'funemployment', and today I start my new gig.

**I'm now Developer Advocate for [Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/) at [InfluxData](https://www.influxdata.com/), and I couldn't be more excited! ðŸŽ‰**

Telegraf is an Open Source "*agent for collecting, processing, aggregating, and writing metrics.*". I'll be working with the Telegraf team and wider community of contributors. You'll likely find me in the [Telegraf GitHub](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf) and on the [InfluxData Community Slack](https://influxdata.com/slack)!

In a bit of excellent timing, this week we're running [Influx Days](https://www.influxdays.com/emea-2021-virtual-experience/) - a virtual event focused on the impact of time series data. I'll be learning along with everyone else who's attending!

I'm really thrilled to be starting a new chapter in my career. Expect my blog posts to change direction a little from here on in.

However, some things don't change. I already nuked Windows 10 from the company-supplied ThinkPad X1, and installed [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/) 21.04 instead. ðŸ¤“
