Earlier today I posted a poll on Mastodon.

As I write this, there are fifteen hours left on the poll, and it looks like this with around a hundred votes:

[![Poll](/images/2023-09-18/poll.png)](/images/2023-09-18/poll.png)

Most people seems to think I should wait for a month. That result may change overnight, of course, but I can't wait! I've got a blog post to write, and time on my hands! 

So let's upgrade now!

*Also, nobody seemed to spot that I got the releases round the wrong way. 23.04 is Lunar, and 23.10 is Mantic. I edited the post, but kept the above screenshot in*

## Upgrades work

So I'm upgrading one of the machines now. I will only upgrade my personal desktop Intel NUC, not the work laptop. For now, at least.

I've long had the opinion that Ubuntu upgrades are generally reliable. On the whole, for most people, most of the time, the upgrade tool from one release to the next, will result in a working system.

Sometimes it doesn't! Let's see what happens when I upgrade the desktop from Ubuntu 23.04 (Lunar) to Ubuntu Mantic Minotaur, which will become 23.10 next month.

**What could possibly go wrong!?**

*(foreshadowing)*

## RTFM

This blog post is *not* an upgrade guide. *Don't* follow blog guides telling you how to upgrade your operating system. That's foolish. 

Go to the official documentation. Let's do a search online. [UpgradeNotes](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes) community documentation sounds about right. Wait a minute...

[![Upgrade Notes](/images/2023-09-18/docs1.png)](/images/2023-09-18/docs1.png)

___"From 16.04 LTS (or 17.10) to 18.04 LTS"!?___ or ___"From 19.04 to 19.10"___, __"last edited 2019-10-27 07:37:02"__. Well that's not right. Oh, wait, it has a link to [https://ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading](https://ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading)...

[![404](/images/2023-09-18/404.png)](/images/2023-09-18/404.png)

Hm. There's got to be some documentation around here somewhere... Our favourite search engine found [this tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/upgrading-ubuntu-desktop#1-before-you-start), which looks promising. But it's really aimed at people upgrading to the next supported release, not development releases. Remember, 23.10 isn't out yet!

I put my big-boy pants on and searched harder, finding [this askubuntu question](https://askubuntu.com/q/12909/612) from the past, which still appears to have accurate answers. 

The answers are `sudo do-release-upgrade -d` or `update-manager -d`. The `-d` meaning to upgrade to the development release.

Ok, let's go.

## Preparation

### Backup. 

After discussing backups on [episode 9](https://linuxmatters.sh/9/) of [Linux Matters](https://linuxmatters.sh/), I now backup my desktop using [BorgBackup](https://www.borgbackup.org/). I get an email every hour, too!

[![Mutt](/images/2023-09-18/mutt.png)](/images/2023-09-18/mutt.png)

I have tested these, and the backups work, unlike the [caravan club](/blog/2023/09/backup-the-caravan/).

### Updates

Before we begin the actual upgrade, it's always a wise idea to have all the latest updates installed for the release I'm running.

```bash
alan@nuc:~$ sudo apt update -qq
48 packages can be upgraded. Run 'apt list --upgradable' to see them.
W: https://packagecloud.io/slacktechnologies/slack/debian/dists/jessie/InRelease: 
Key is stored in legacy trusted.gpg keyring (/etc/apt/trusted.gpg), 
see the DEPRECATION section in apt-key(8) for details.
```

Whatever, I should do something about that warning someday.

*Future popey here to point out that I don't need to do anything about this, because the upgrade will automagically disable the third party reposistory, making this warning **vanish**.*

```bash
alan@nuc:~$ sudo apt full-upgrade -qq
The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:
  grub-pc-bin linux-headers-6.2.0-20
Use 'sudo apt autoremove' to remove them.
The following packages will be upgraded:
  code cups cups-bsd cups-client cups-common cups-core-drivers cups-daemon
  cups-ipp-utils cups-ppdc cups-server-common curl google-chrome-stable
  libcups2 libcupsimage2 libcurl3-gnutls libcurl4 libnss-systemd

Ok, we're up to date on 23.04.

## Upgrade

Time to upgrade.

I'm a terminal nerd (geddit?) so I will use a command-line interface for my upgrade. Even though I'm on a graphical desktop! What a *maverick* *meerkat*!

Do you want to start the upgrade? 


8 packages are going to be removed. 113 new packages are going to be 
installed. 1620 packages are going to be upgraded. 

You have to download a total of 2,570 M. This download will take 
about 8 minutes with a 40Mbit connection and about 1 hour 8 minutes 
with a 5Mbit connection. 

Fetching and installing the upgrade can take several hours. Once the 
download has finished, the process cannot be canceled.

## Black screen of doom

It was at this moment he knew, he f'ed up.

All three screens suddenly went black, and I was left with just a flashing cursor. Here's a simulation of what that looked like:

```text

```

My first reaction was "Oh gosh, this seems suboptimal", or words to that effect. 


[![Mild shock](/images/2023-09-18/mildshock.gif)](/images/2023-09-18/mildshock.gif)


The disk light was still flickering like mad though, so I assumed upgrade things were still happening. I wandered off to find a laptop so I could SSH in to have a poke around.

## Check the logs

Once in, I looked in `/var/log/dist-upgrade` and found stuff still being written to `main.log` and `apt.log`.

In previous releases, if GNU screen was installed, the upgrade tool would automatically launch inside a screen session. I would have been able to reconnect to the process, and see what was going on.

Unfortunately, that didn't seem to be the case with my upgrade, and I didn't manually launch it inside a `screen` or `tmux` session. So I couldn't reconnect to it.

However, looking at the main.log, it looks like we may be finished, probably at the stage where the upgrade tool is asking for confirmation to remove packages that are no longer required.

## Kill it with fire

The only thing I can do at this point is kill the upgrade, and then cleanup manually - which isn't hard.

The upgrade tool has the name of the release in it, so I look for the process.

```bash 
root@nuc:~# ps aux | grep mantic
