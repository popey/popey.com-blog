I was a guest host on [Late Night Linux](https://latenightlinux.com/) podcast, episode [249](https://latenightlinux.com/late-night-linux-episode-249/) last week, filling in for [Will](https://github.com/8none1). We each bring along a 'discovery', I brought [snapcraft metrics](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapcraft-metrics) to talk about. I thought I'd write up how I use them, for listeners of the show as it's hard to articulate this very well verbally.

## My snaps

I have about twenty snaps in the [snap store](https://snapcraft.io/publisher/popey). Some, like [Bombsquad](https://snapcraft.io/bombsquad) and [ncspot](https://snapcraft.io/ncspot) have been published for years now. Others such as [Classicube](https://snapcraft.io/classicube) were more recently built and published.

When I left Canonical in 2021, suffering a little *snap-burnout*, I [asked](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/looking-for-someone-to-maintain-some-snaps/28354?u=popey) on the [snapcraft forum](https://forum.snapcraft.io/) for help in maintaining some of them. Thankfully some people stepped up and helped. But a lot of them are still under my publishing control.

I've recently been re-examining them, updating them and fixing issues. Beyond the twenty-or-so public, up-to-date snaps, there are another twenty more that need some work.

## Your month in snaps

Every eighth of the month, all snap publishers get an email. I've been getting these every month for the last five years! They're a good reminder that there are actual computers out there, with your work on them. 

[!["Your month in snaps" email](/images/2023-10-08/email.png)](/images/2023-10-08/email.png)

It lists each snap you have published, along with the channels, released versions, and interestingly, the number of "weekly active devices". It only lists released snaps with more than 10 users. So a prototype snap which only the developer has installed, won't show up in the stats.

[![ncspot email](/images/2023-10-08/ncspot.png)](/images/2023-10-08/ncspot.png)

Typically a publisher will only have a small number of snaps in the store. I'd imagine the vast majority have exactly one published snap. The average goes up when you consider organisations like [KDE](https://snapcraft.io/publisher/kde) with 161 snaps, and companies such as [JetBrains](https://snapcraft.io/publisher/jetbrains) with 16.

## Store metrics

Every machine running `snapd`, and having snaps installed, will check-in with the snap store periodically. Some more [periodically](https://snapcraft.io/docs/keeping-snaps-up-to-date#heading--settings) than [others](https://snapcraft.io/docs/keeping-snaps-up-to-date#heading--hold). By default a few times a day, `snapd` will see if any installed snaps require updates. It sends a unique generated machine ID along with the list of snaps and revisions currently installed. It also sends architecture information and details of the host OS.

The store can then reply with a list of available updates, that `snapd` can process. The store backend stashes the data about how many users, what OS and other data each snap has, and presents it to the publisher. 

Let's look at the graphs for one application I published, 'ncspot'. The ncspot app is a command line 'ncurses' interface to Spotify. This is ideal for low-power computers, or those for which no 'full fat' Spotify client exists.

### ncspot by version

I love this graph, clearly shows the automatic update of snaps in action. Each wave of colour depicts a new release of ncspot rolling out the users.

### ncspot by architecture

Somewhere out there, there are a dozen machines with the 32-bit Intel "i386" architecture builds of ncspot! I imagine it's one of the easiest ways to get a Spotify player on those computers.

### ncspot by os

This one always makes me smile. "But but but! Snaps only work on Ubuntu.". Nope. Check this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QiAp5GPFjsHTQVN_D0pXvhE4sfj23vW3YL8PQPxRkzA/edit?usp=sharing) to see the other distros this snap is installed on. More on that below.

### ncspot by channel

I love that some fourty intrepid souls are running edge builds of ncspot!

## snapcraft metrics

While the graphs and emails are great, publishers may want to slice and dice the data themselves. So the `snapcraft` command has a `metrics` option, which enables publishers to grab current and historical metrics data for their applications. 

It's all documented in the [snapcraft docs](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapcraft-metrics) but here is an example. Here we query the store for "Installed base by OS" which "contains one series per operating_system representing the number of devices with the given snap installed.". We grab the past 90 days data, with the output in plain text rather than json format.

`snapcraft --verbose metrics ncspot --name installed_base_by_operating_system --start $(date +%Y-%m-%d -d "90 days ago") --end $(date +%Y-%m-%d -d yesterday) --format=table
`

Here's a small snippet of the raw data that gets returned. This is w i d e. I have uploaded the full set to this publicly viewable [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QiAp5GPFjsHTQVN_D0pXvhE4sfj23vW3YL8PQPxRkzA/edit?usp=sharing) or this [text file](https://popey.com/~alan/snapcraft/2023-10-08/ncspot-installed_base_by_operating_system.txt).

I've put a snapshot of all the metrics data for every snap I publish [here](https://popey.com/~alan/snapcraft/2023-10-08/) in case anyone is interested. They're all pretty small-fry numbers compared to some of the high-profile applications in the store. But seeing any number of machines installing this stuff I maintain is motivational to me!
