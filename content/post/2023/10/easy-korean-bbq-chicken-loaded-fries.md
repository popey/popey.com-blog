As with all recipes on this blog, they're designed to be easily made, tasty, and not elaborate. I'll also not put lengthy backstories for them.

I was in Exeter yesterday and stumbled into Brewdog where I discovered their delicious loaded fries. So today, I had a go at making something similar. The amount I used here could be shared between four people as a chunky sharing starter. Scale it down for a main meal or snack.

This is what inspired me, the loaded fries from Brewdog. They were delicious.

Here's my version, and yes, there are some fries buried under all that chicken!

I used shop-prepared breadcrumbed chicken and frozen fries, but you could just as easily make your own if you have time. This recipe was made with speed and ease at the core, hence buying some pre-processed ingredients. This takes about twenty minutes to prepare and cook, if that.

The pickled red onion benefits from sitting longer, and everything is optional. Add whatever vegetables, sauces and herbs you prefer. This was just how I did it.

Also, I used an air fryer, but that's not necessary. It is necessary, however, for me to mention that I used one because like, vegans and Arch Linux users, we have to tell you.

## Ingredients

* 1 small red onion - thinly sliced
* 1 green onion (scallion) - sliced
* 1 salad tomato - roughly chopped
* Grated cheese - cheddar is fine, whatever you like
* Fries - frozen are fine
* Chicken (I used Co-Op [hot and spicy chicken mini fillets](https://shop.coop.co.uk/product/e6558540-d577-4485-b2c4-6d33e64ee201))
* Korean BBQ sauce - or any BBQ sauce really, but my Son likes this
* Vinegar - White wine or apple cider
* Sriracha mayo - or separately sriracha (or your favourite chilli sauce) & mayo 

## Method

1. Put a large serving bowl on a warmer if you have one
2. Quickly pickle the red onion. Put slices in a bowl and pour over just enough vinegar to cover. Add a little sugar or honey to sweeten. Then pour some boiling water over them. Cover and set aside.
3. Put the fries and chicken pieces in the warmed-up air fryer. If the fries are frozen, give them a few minutes extra before adding the chicken.
4. Chop the tomato into small bite-size pieces
5. When the fries & chicken are nearly done, warm the BBQ sauce in a small frying pan, big enough to hold all the chicken pieces
6. When the fries are done, place them in the bowl, then liberally sprinkle with the cheese
7. Roughly chop the cooked crispy chicken and place it in the pan, turning over in the sauce a couple of times to make sure it's coated. It shouldn't be in there long, just long enough to absorb all the sauce
8. Place chicken on top of the fries & cheese
9. Add tomato, green onions, some drained pickled red onion slices
10. Drizzle with sriracha mayo
