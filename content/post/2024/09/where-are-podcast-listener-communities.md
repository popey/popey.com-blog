## Parasocial chat

On [Linux Matters](https://linuxmatters.sh/) we have a friendly and active, public [Telegram channel](https://linuxmatters.sh/telegram) linked on our [Contact](https://linuxmatters.sh/contact) page, along with a [Discord Channel](https://discord.com/invite/wgQsshhrWW). We also have links to [Mastodon](https://ubuntu.social/@linuxmatters), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/linuxmatters) (not that we use it that much) and email.

At the time of writing there are roughly this ‚¨áÔ∏è number of people (plus bots, sockpuppets and duplicates) in or following each Linux Matters "official" presence:

| Channel | Number |
| :-- | --: |
| Telegram | 796 |
| Discord | 683 |
| Mastodon | 858 |
| Twitter | 9919 |


## Preponderance of chat

We chose to have a presence in lots of places, but primarily the ~~talent~~ presenters (Martin, Mark, and myself (and Joe)) only really hang out to chat on [Telegram](https://linuxmatters.sh/telegram) and [Mastodon](https://ubuntu.social/@linuxmatters). 

I originally created the Telegram channel on November 20th, 2015, when we were publishing the Ubuntu Podcast (RIP in Peace) A.K.A. Ubuntu UK Podcast. We co-opted and renamed the channel when Linux Matters launched in 2023.

Prior to the channel's existence, we used the Ubuntu UK Local Community (LoCo) Team IRC channel on Freenode (also, RIP in Peace). 

We also re-branded our existing Mastodon accounts from the old Ubuntu Podcast to Linux Matters.

We mostly continue using Telegram and Mastodon as our primary methods of communication because on the whole they're fast, reliable, stay synced across devices, have the features we enjoy, and at least one of them isn't run by a weird billionaire. 

## Other options

We link to a lot of other places at the top of the [Linux Matters home page](https://linuxmatters.sh), where our listeners can chat, mostly to eachother and not us. 

Being over 16, I'm not a big fan of [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wgQsshhrWW), and I know Mark doesn't even have an account there. None of us use [Twitter](https://popey.com/hellscape/?destination=https://www.twitter.com/) much anymore, either.

Periodically I ponder if we ([Linux Matters](https://linuxmatters.sh/)) *should* use something other than Telegram. I know some *listeners* really don't like the platform, but prefer other places like [Signal](https://signal.org/), [Matrix](https://cinny.in/) or even [IRC](https://snapcraft.io/halloy). I know for sure some *non-listeners* don't like Telegram, but I care less about their opinions. 

Part of the problem is that I don't think any of us really *enjoy* the other realtime chat alternatives. Both Matrix and Signal have terrible user experience, and other flaws. Which is why you don't tend to find us hanging out in either of those places.

There are further options I haven't even considered, like [Wire](https://wire.com/), [WhatsApp](https://popey.com/hellscape/?destination=https://www.whatsapp.com/), and likely [more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Comic_Chat) I don't even know or care about. 

So we kept using Telegram over any of the above alternative options. 

## Pondering Posting Polls

I have repeatedly considered asking the listeners about their preferred chat platforms via our existing channels. But that seems flawed, because we use what we like, and no matter how many people prefer something else, we're unlikely to move. Unless something strange [happens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_and_indictment_of_Pavel_Durov) üëÄ .

Plus, often times, especially on decentralised platforms, the *audience* can be somewhat "over-enthusiastic" about their preferred way being `The Way‚Ñ¢Ô∏è` over the alternatives. It won't do us any favours to get data saying 40% report we should use Signal, 40% suggest Matrix and 20% choose XMPP, if the four of us won't use any of them.

## Pursue Podcast Palaver Proposals

So rather than ask **our** audience, I thought I'd see what **other** podcasters promote for feedback and chatter on *their* websites. 

I picked a random set from shows I have heard of, and may have listened to, plus a few extra ones I haven't. None of this is endorsement or approval, I wanted the facts, just the [fax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2Ct0ouRooY), ma'am. 

I collated the data in a [json](https://gist.github.com/popey/b86a12e0b1cf8dd832fd6b56a4231c4f) file for some reason, then generated the tables below. I don't know what to do with this information, but it's a bit of data we may use if we ever decide to move away from Telegram.

## Presenting Pint-Sized Payoff

The table shows some nerdy podcasts along with their primary means (as far as I can tell) of community engagement. Data was gathered manually from podcast home pages and "about" pages. I *generally* didn't go into the page content for each episode. I made an exception for "Dot Social" and "Linux OTC" because there's *nothing* but episodes on their home page.

It doesn't matter for this research, I just thought it was interesting that some podcasters don't feel the need to break out their contact details to a separate page, or make it more obvious. Perhaps they feel that listeners are likely to be viewing an episode page, or looking at a specific show metadata, so it's better putting the contact details there.

*I haven't included YouTube, where many shows publish and discuss, in addition to a podcast feed.*

I am also aware that some people exclusively, or perhaps primarily publish on YouTube (or other video platforms). Those aren't podcasts [IMNSHO](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/IMNSHO).

Key to the tables below. Column names have been shorted because it's a w i d e table. The numbers indicate how many podcasts use that communication platform.

## Point

Not entirely sure what to do with this [data](https://gist.github.com/popey/b86a12e0b1cf8dd832fd6b56a4231c4f). But there it is.

Is Linux Matters going to move away from Telegram to something else? No idea.
